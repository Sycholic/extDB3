# extDB3
This repository is an archive to download extDB3, since the repository was closed by bitbucket https://bitbucket.org/torndeco/extdb3/.

A x64 version for Linux is now available! 

Released a new version for Windows that changes small things in the library.

EDIT: This fork will look into making this build properly and not doing some dodgy method of compiling. Let alone why use yet another... different memory handler.  
      Attempting to make this use the default dll and maybe any of the included arma 3 memory handlers.  Why NOT use the same one your server is running on?  
      This never made any sense to moment seen this... even if this is loaded as a mod should you not be using the same memory handler as the program you running inside/called from?
